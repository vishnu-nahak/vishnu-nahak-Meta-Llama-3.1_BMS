## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete books and their reviews.
- **Summary Generation**: Generate summaries for books using the Hugging Face Llama model.
- **CORS Support**: Easily integrate with frontend applications.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An ORM for database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used for storing book and review data.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For generating summaries.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **dotenv**: To load environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PostgreSQL (for the database)
- pip (Python package manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git https://github.com/vishnu-nahak/vishnu-nahak-Meta-Llama-3.1_BMS.git

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following command:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following variables:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://username:password@localhost:5432/DBname
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token

Replace username, password, and your_huggingface_token with your PostgreSQL credentials and Hugging Face API token.

### 5. Set Up the Database
Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running. You may need to create the database using the following SQL command:
CREATE DATABASE DBname;

### 6. Run the Application
Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

The API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000

### 7. Access the API Documentation
You can explore the API documentation automatically generated by FastAPI at:

Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
ReDoc: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
Usage
You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or curl. Below are some example endpoints you can use:

Using Swagger UI to Test Your API
	1. Access Swagger UI: Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs. This will show you the interactive documentation for your FastAPI application.
	2. Explore Endpoints: On the Swagger UI page, you will see a list of all the endpoints you defined in your main.py. Each endpoint will have a section where you can view details about the request parameters and response schemas.
	3. Test Endpoints:
